# Synopsis
  This repository contains the work I did for the second project for the Coursera course "Reproducible Research".  
  This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/).  
  The resulting study is available in the file `case_study.Rmd`.  
  Also accessible from GutHub pages at: https://pascal-p.github.io/PA02_RR/ and Rpubs(R studio): https://rpubs.com/Pascal/pa02_rr
